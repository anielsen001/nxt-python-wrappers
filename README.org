* set up python software

** nxt-python
   
https://github.com/Eelviny/nxt-python/tree/master

must use python 2 and tag v2.2.2 do not use master branch to build
will not work with python3

use: git checkout v2.2.2

** test if things work

https://onegoodapp.wordpress.com/2013/07/02/raspberry-pi-model-b-setup-to-communicate-with-nxt/

wget http://home.wlu.edu/~levys/courses/csci250s2013/nxt_beep.py

run python nxt_beep.py and the nxt should beep if things work.
I had to turn on the volume on the nxt brick first.
